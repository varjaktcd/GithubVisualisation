In powershell, run these on the directory of the code
```
CODE_DIRECTORY\venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
```

```
docker compose build
```

```
docker compose up
```

Run ```process.py``` to acess the database and process its data.
  
I've included shell scripts if you wish to use those.
